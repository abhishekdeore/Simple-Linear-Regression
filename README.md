# Simple-Linear-Regression

I started learning about Linear Regression and the first type that I am currently studying is the Simple Linear Regression. I will also upload my notes which will be in HINGLSIH which will help in getting deeper understanding about the algorithm.

I have implemented this algorithm on a dataset called as student clustering dataset from kaggle which contains 2 columns viz 'cgpa' and 'iq'. Data was neither linear nor sort of linear inorder to draw the best fit line; but this is just an implementation part from my side.

I will implemnent this algorithm on real world datasets having good quality of linear or sort of linear datapoints in future.
